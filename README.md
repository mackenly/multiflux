# Multiflux 🎥
Cloud Multistreaming Platform Powered by Cloudflare Workers

**Note**
This project is in development. You'll need an API token from your cloudflare account to use it.

This project utilizes the [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/workers/), [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and [Cloudflare Stream](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/) APIs to create a multistreaming platform.

## Purpose:
Multistreaming can be costly and complicated. Services such as Restream™ and Castr™ provide most of the features users need but don't give you the same flexibility, customizability, or cost savings as self deployed solutions. Other solutions do exist, such as configuring a NGINX server to redistribute incoming streams, but that requires heavy knowlege of config files and leaves much to be desired when it comes to user firendlyness.

Multiflux allows anyone to deploy the project onto their own Cloudlfare account and utilize their Workers, Pages, KV, and Stream services for as little as $10/m.

## Deployment
TODO - How to deploy (include [deploy button](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-deploy-buttons/)) - not sure if this is possible since everything is now on Pages

## How Tos
TODO - Provide setup tutorials

## Settings and Options
TODO - Explain various settings and options avaliable

## Contributing
This project welcomes contributions from anyone who wants to contribute to the project. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
