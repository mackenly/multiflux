## Purpose:
Multistream can be costly and complicated. Services such as Restream™ and Castr™ provide most of the features users need but don't give you the same flexibility, customizability, or cost savings as self deployed solutions. Other solutions do exist, such as configuring a NGINX server to redistribute incoming streams, but that requires heavy knowlege of config files and leaves much to be desired when it comes to user firendlyness.

Multistream allows anyone to deploy the project onto their own Cloudlfare account and utilize their Workers, Pages, KV, and Stream services for as little as $5/m.
